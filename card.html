            <p id="italic">The Golden Retriever is a medium-large gun dog that was bred to retrieve shot waterfowl,
                such as ducks and upland game
                birds, during hunting and shooting parties. The name "retriever" refers to the breed's ability to
                retrieve shot game
                undamaged due to their soft mouth.</p>

            <p id="Normal_text">Golden retrievers have an instinctive love of water, and are easy to train to basic or advanced obedience
                standards.
                They are a long-coated breed, with a dense inner coat that provides them with adequate warmth in the
                outdoors, and an
                outer coat that lies flat against their bodies and repels water.</p>
